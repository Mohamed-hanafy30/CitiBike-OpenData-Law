CitiBike-OpenData-Law
=====================

On 24 July 2013, Council Member Brad Lander introduced Int. No 1117-2013. This is a local law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to requiring the complication of Citi Bike usage data. 

You can track this law on the New York City Council Legistar system at < http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1458686&GUID=A0A12057-4AE3-4CC8-BCD3-3277B0F7E1E0&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search >.

This repository is designed to take the initial text as posted on 24 July 2013 and make this bill the best open data bike share law possible. Addtionally, in the wiki you will find a prototype of a Bike Share Open Data schema and proposed ideas around other bike ecosystem data < https://github.com/noneck/CitiBike-OpenData-Law/wiki/Bike-share-open-data-schema >.

In the wiki < https://github.com/noneck/CitiBike-OpenData-Law/wiki >, you will find links to other bike share open data systems, outlines of the data they provide, and examples of other open data bike share laws.
